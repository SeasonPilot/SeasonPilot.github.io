IntroductionThe Go memory model specifies the conditions under which reads of a variable in one goroutine can be guaranteed to observe values produced by writes to the same variable in a different goroutine.AdvicePrograms that modify data being simultaneously accessed by multiple goroutines must serialize such access.To serialize access,protect the data with channel operations or other synchronization primitives such as those in the sync and sync/atomic packages.If you must read the rest of this document to understand the behavior of your program,you are being too clever.Don't be clever.Informal OverviewGo approaches its memory model in much the same way as the rest of the language,aiming to keep the semantics simple,understandable,and useful. This section gives a general overview of the approach and should suffice for most programmers. The memory model is specified more formally in the next section.A data race is defined as a write to a memory location happening concurrently with another read or write to that same location,unless all the accesses involved are atomic data accesses as provided by the sync/atomic package. As noted already,programmers are strongly encouraged to use appropriate synchronization to avoid data races. In the absence of data races,there are limitations to what a Go implementation can do in response to a data race. An implementation may always react to a data race by reporting the race and terminating the program. Otherwise,in that most races have a limited number of outcomes,where the meaning of any program with a race is entirely undefined,while still insisting that races are errors and that tools can diagnose and report them.Memory ModelThe following formal definition of Go's memory model closely follows the approach presented by Hans-J. Boehm and Sarita V. Adve in “Foundations of the C++ Concurrency Memory Model”,which are made up of goroutine executions,indicating whether it is an ordinary data read,or a synchronizing operation such as an atomic data access,or a channel operation,the memory location or variable being accessed,including read,mutex lock,including write,mutex unlock,and channel close. Some,are both read-like and write-like.A goroutine execution is modeled as a set of memory operations executed by a single goroutine.Requirement 1: The memory operations in each goroutine must correspond to a correct sequential execution of that goroutine,defined as the partial order requirements set out by the Go language specification for Go's control flow constructs as well as the order of evaluation for expressions.A Go program execution is modeled as a set of goroutine executions,the mapping W,must be explainable by some implicit total order of the synchronizing operations that is consistent with sequencing and the values read and written by those operations.The synchronized before relation is a partial order on synchronizing memory operations,if W(r) = w),the synchronized before relation is a subset of the implied total order mentioned in the previous paragraph,W(r) must be a write w that is visible to r,at least one of which is non-synchronizing,neither r happens before w nor w happens before r).A write-write data race on memory location x consists of two write-like memory operations w and w' on x,at least one of which is non-synchronizing,then any read r on x has only one possible W(r): the single w that immediately precedes it in the happens before order.More generally,meaning it has no program executions with read-write or write-write data races,including C,Java,Rust,any implementation can,report the race and halt execution of the program. Implementations using ThreadSanitizer (accessed with “go build -race”) do exactly this.Otherwise,each read must observe a value written by a preceding or concurrent write.Additionally,observing a single allowed write w. For performance reasons,length) or (pointer,as can be the case for interface values,slices,such races can in turn lead to arbitrary memory corruption.Examples of incorrect synchronization are given in the “Incorrect synchronization” section below.Examples of the limitations on implementations are given in the “Incorrect compilation” section below.Synchronization
InitializationProgram initialization runs in a single goroutine,which run concurrently.If a package p imports package q,in this program:var a stringfunc f() {
	print(a)
}func hello() {
	a = "hello,world" at some point in the future (perhaps after hello has returned).Goroutine destructionThe exit of a goroutine is not guaranteed to be synchronized before any event in the program. For example,so it is not guaranteed to be observed by any other goroutine. In fact,use a synchronization mechanism such as a lock or channel communication to establish a relative ordering.Channel communicationChannel communication is the main method of synchronization between goroutines. Each send on a particular channel is matched to a corresponding receive from that channel,10)
var a stringfunc f() {
	a = "hello,world". The write to a is sequenced before the send on c,which is sequenced before the print.The closing of a channel is synchronized before a receive that returns a zero value because the channel is closed.In the previous example,but with the send and receive statements swapped and using an unbuffered channel):var c = make(chan int)
var a stringfunc f() {
	a = "hello,world"
	<-c
}func main() {
	go f()
	c <- 0
	print(a)
}
is also guaranteed to print "hello,which is synchronized before the corresponding send on c completes,c = make(chan int,world". (It might print the empty string,or do something else.)The kth receive on a channel with capacity C is synchronized before the completion of the k+Cth send from that channel completes.This rule generalizes the previous rule to buffered channels. It allows a counting semaphore to be modeled by a buffered channel: the number of items in the channel corresponds to the number of active uses,sending an item acquires the semaphore,but the goroutines coordinate using the limit channel to ensure that at most three are running work functions at a time.var limit = make(chan int,w := range work {
		go func(w func()) {
			limit <- 1
			w()
			<-limit
		}(w)
	}
	select{}
}LocksThe sync package implements two lock data types,call n of l.Unlock() is synchronized before call m of l.Lock() returns.This program:var l sync.Mutex
var a stringfunc f() {
	a = "hello,world". The first call to l.Unlock() (in f) is synchronized before the second call to l.Lock() (in main) returns,there is an n such that the nth call to l.Unlock is synchronized before the return from l.RLock,l.TryLock (or l.TryRLock) may be considered to be able to return false even when the mutex l is unlocked.OnceThe sync package provides a safe mechanism for initialization in the presence of multiple goroutines through the use of the Once type. Multiple threads can execute once.Do(f) for a particular f,and the other calls block until f() has returned.The completion of a single call of f() from once.Do(f) is synchronized before the return of any call of once.Do(f).In this program:var a string
var once sync.Oncefunc setup() {
	a = "hello,world" will be printed twice.Atomic ValuesThe APIs in the sync/atomic package are collectively “atomic operations” that can be used to synchronize the execution of different goroutines. If the effect of an atomic operation A is observed by atomic operation B,f) is synchronized before the finalization call f(x).Additional MechanismsThe sync package provides additional synchronization abstractions,lock-free maps,and wait groups. The documentation for each of these specifies the guarantees it makes concerning synchronization.Other packages that provide synchronization abstractions should document the guarantees they make too.Incorrect synchronizationPrograms with races are incorrect and can exhibit non-sequentially consistent executions. In particular,it does not imply that reads happening after r will observe writes that happened before w.In this program:var a,the twoprint program might be incorrectly written as:var a string
var done boolfunc setup() {
	a = "hello,done {
		once.Do(setup)
	}
	print(a)
}func twoprint() {
	go doprint()
	go doprint()
}
but there is no guarantee that,observing the write to done implies observing the write to a. This version can (incorrectly) print an empty string instead of "hello,as in:var a string
var done boolfunc setup() {
	a = "hello,done {
	}
	print(a)
}
As before,in main,observing the write to done implies observing the write to a,there is no guarantee that the write to done will ever be observed by main,such as this program.type T struct {
	msg string
}var g *Tfunc setup() {
	t := new(T)
	t.msg = "hello,= nil and exits its loop,the solution is the same: use explicit synchronization.Incorrect compilationThe Go memory model restricts compiler optimizations as much as it does Go programs. Some compiler optimizations that would be valid in single-threaded programs are not valid in all Go programs. In particular,it must not allow a single read to observe multiple values,a compiler must not invert the conditional in this program:*p = 1
if cond {
	*p = 2
}
That is,cond {
	*p = 1
}
If cond is false and another goroutine is reading *p,the other goroutine can only observe any prior value of *p and 1. In the rewritten program,which was previously impossible.Not introducing data races also means not assuming that loops terminate. For example,e,e = e.next {
	n++
}
i := *p
*q = 1
If list pointed to a cyclic list,but the rewritten program would. (Moving `*p` ahead would be safe if the compiler can prove `*p` will not panic,a compiler must not move the accesses to *p or *q ahead of the function call in this program (at least not without direct knowledge of the precise behavior of f):f()
i := *p
*q = 1
If the call never returned,but the rewritten program would. And if the call contained synchronizing operations,but the rewritten program would not.Not allowing a single read to observe multiple values means not reloading local variables from shared memory. For example,a compiler for single-threaded programs could discard i without saving a copy and then reload i = *p just before funcs[i](). A Go compiler must not,the compiler could spill i to the stack.)Not allowing a single write to write multiple values also means not using the memory where a local variable will be written as temporary storage before the write. For example,it must not rewrite the program into this one:*p /= 2
*p += i
If i and *p start equal to 2,so a racing thread can read only 2 or 3 from *p. The rewritten code does *p = 1 and then *p = 3,the original code does *p = 3,so a racing thread can read only 2 or 3 from *p. The rewritten code does *p = 1 and then *p = 3,allowing a racing thread to read 1 as well.Note that all these optimizations are permitted in C/C++ compilers: a Go compiler sharing a back end with a C/C++ compiler must take care to disable optimizations that are invalid for Go.Note that the prohibition on introducing data races does not apply if the compiler can prove that the races do not affect correct execution on the target platform. For example,on essentially all CPUs,it is valid to rewriten := 0
for i := 0,i < m,i++ {
	n += *shared
}into:
n := 0
local := *shared
for i := 0,i < m,i++ {
	n += local
}
provided it can be proved that *shared will not fault on access,because the potential added read will not affect any existing concurrent reads or writes. On the other hand,the rewrite would not be valid in a source-to-source translator.ConclusionGo programmers writing data-race-free programs can rely on sequentially consistent execution of those programs,just as in essentially all other modern programming languages.When it comes to programs with races,both programmers and compilers should remember the advice: don't be clever.,

Question:

我想了解上文“http://golang.org/ref/mem#tmp_5”的详细内容

Answer:

您好，这是必应。您想了解的文章是关于**Go语言的内存模型**的<sup>1</sup>。这篇文章介绍了Go语言在内存管理方面的基本原理和规则，以及如何在多线程编程中保证数据的一致性和同步<sup>1</sup>。文章分为两部分，第一部分是非正式的概述，适合大多数程序员阅读；第二部分是更正式的规范，适合那些想深入了解Go语言内部机制的人阅读<sup>1</sup>。

您想了解的部分是**tmp_5**，这是一个临时标签，用于指向文章中的一个例子<sup>1</sup>。这个例子展示了如何使用**sync.Mutex**来保护共享变量的访问<sup>1</sup>。代码如下：

```go
var l sync.Mutex
var a string

func f() {
	a = "hello, world"
	l.Unlock()
}

func main() {
	l.Lock()
	go f()
	l.Lock()
	print(a)
}
```

这段代码中，**l.Unlock()**在**a = "hello, world"**之后发生，而**l.Lock()**在**print(a)**之前发生，因此可以保证打印出的结果是"hello, world"，而不是空字符串或其他值<sup>1</sup>。
