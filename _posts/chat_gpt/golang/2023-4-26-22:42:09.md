Question:

Reply in Chinese (Simplified).
Below is the content from a developer Q&A platform. Analyze answers and provide a brief solution that can solve the question first,then give an overview of all answers. The question is: "what's the mearning of `sudog` in the channel struct in Go?", and the further description of the question is: "
                
According to Golang source code:
A sudog is simply a goroutine that is waiting on an element. The sudog struct has these elements
type sudog struct{
   g *g
   isSelect bool
   next *sudog
   prev *sudog
   elem unsafe.Pointer //data element
   ...
}

I want to know what's the hidden meaning of sudo? what's it short for?
    ".The answers are as follows:
answer1: 
                
The general consensus is that a sudog is a pseudo-G, as it is used to keep a list of G's.  There is some discussion on https://golang.org/cl/20774.

Answer:

你好，这是必应。我可以用中文回复你。😊

根据搜索结果，sudog是一个用于保存等待元素的goroutine的结构体，它的名字可能是pseudo-G的缩写，表示它是一个伪造的G<sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup>。pseudo-G的含义是它用于保存G的列表<sup>1</sup>。

问题的答案只有一个，就是sudog是pseudo-G的缩写，表示它是一个伪造的G。这个答案在https://golang.org/cl/20774上有一些讨论<sup>1</sup>。
