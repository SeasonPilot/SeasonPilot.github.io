Binary operatorsPrometheus's query language supports basic logical and arithmetic operators. For operations between two instant vectors,the matching behavior can be modified.Arithmetic binary operatorsThe following binary arithmetic operators exist in Prometheus:+ (addition)
- (subtraction)
* (multiplication)
/ (division)
% (modulo)
^ (power/exponentiation)Binary arithmetic operators are defined between scalar/scalar,vector/scalar,and vector/vector value pairs.Between two scalars,the behavior is obvious: they evaluate to another scalar that is the result of the operator applied to both scalar operands.Between an instant vector and a scalar,the operator is applied to the value of every data sample in the vector. E.g. if a time series instant vector is multiplied by 2,the result is another vector in which every sample value of the original vector is multiplied by 2. The metric name is dropped.Between two instant vectors,which work in radians,exist in Prometheus:atan2 (based on https://pkg.go.dev/math#Atan2)Trigonometric operators allow trigonometric functions to be executed on two vectors using vector matching,which isn't available with normal functions. They act in the same manner as arithmetic operators.Comparison binary operatorsThe following binary comparison operators exist in Prometheus:== (equal),= (not-equal)
> (greater-than)
< (less-than)
>= (greater-or-equal)
<= (less-or-equal)Comparison operators are defined between scalar/scalar,vector/scalar,and vector/vector value pairs. By default they filter. Their behavior can be modified by providing bool after the operator,which will return 0 or 1 for the value rather than filtering.Between two scalars,the bool modifier must be provided and these operators result in another scalar that is either 0 (false) or 1 (true),depending on the comparison result.Between an instant vector and a scalar,these operators are applied to the value of every data sample in the vector,and vector elements between which the comparison result is false get dropped from the result vector. If the bool modifier is provided,these operators behave as a filter by default,applied to matching entries. Vector elements for which the expression is not true or which do not find a match on the other side of the expression get dropped from the result,while the others are propagated into a result vector with the grouping labels becoming the output label set. If the bool modifier is provided,vector elements that would have been dropped instead have the value 0 and vector elements that would be kept have the value 1,with the grouping labels again becoming the output label set. The metric name is dropped if the bool modifier is provided.Logical/set binary operatorsThese logical/set binary operators are only defined between instant vectors:and (intersection)
or (union)
unless (complement)vector1 and vector2 results in a vector consisting of the elements of vector1 for which there are elements in vector2 with exactly matching label sets. Other elements are dropped. The metric name and values are carried over from the left-hand side vector.vector1 or vector2 results in a vector that contains all original elements (label sets + values) of vector1 and additionally all elements of vector2 which do not have matching label sets in vector1.vector1 unless vector2 results in a vector consisting of the elements of vector1 for which there are no elements in vector2 with exactly matching label sets. All matching elements in both vectors are dropped.Vector matchingOperations between vectors attempt to find a matching element in the right-hand side vector for each entry in the left-hand side. There are two basic types of matching behavior: One-to-one and many-to-one/one-to-many.Vector matching keywordsThese vector matching keywords allow for matching between series with different label sets providing:on
ignoringLabel lists provided to matching keywords will determine how vectors are combined. Examples can be found in One-to-one vector matches and in Many-to-one and one-to-many vector matchesGroup modifiersThese group modifiers enable many-to-one/one-to-many vector matching:group_left
group_rightLabel lists can be provided to the group modifier which contain labels from the "one"-side to be included in the result metrics.Many-to-one and one-to-many matching are advanced use cases that should be carefully considered. Often a proper use of ignoring(<labels>) provides the desired outcome.Grouping modifiers can only be used for comparison and arithmetic. Operations as and,unless and or operations match with all possible entries in the right vector by default.One-to-one vector matchesOne-to-one finds a unique pair of entries from each side of the operation. In the default case,that is an operation following the format vector1 <operator> vector2. Two entries match if they have the exact same set of labels and corresponding values. The ignoring keyword allows ignoring certain labels when matching,while the on keyword allows reducing the set of considered labels to a provided list:<vector expr> <bin-op> ignoring(<label list>) <vector expr>
<vector expr> <bin-op> on(<label list>) <vector expr>
Example input:method_code:http_errors:rate5m{method="get",code="500"}24
method_code:http_errors:rate5m{method="get",code="404"}30
method_code:http_errors:rate5m{method="put",code="500"} 6
method_code:http_errors:rate5m{method="post",code="404"} 21method:http_requests:rate5m{method="get"}600
method:http_requests:rate5m{method="del"}34
method:http_requests:rate5m{method="post"} 120
Example query:method_code:http_errors:rate5m{code="500"} / ignoring(code) method:http_requests:rate5m
This returns a result vector containing the fraction of HTTP requests with status code of 500 for each method,as measured over the last 5 minutes. Without ignoring(code) there would have been no match as the metrics do not share the same set of labels. The entries with methods put and del have no match and will not show up in the result:{method="get"}0.04//24 / 600
{method="post"} 0.05// 6 / 120Many-to-one and one-to-many vector matchesMany-to-one and one-to-many matchings refer to the case where each vector element on the "one"-side can match with multiple elements on the "many"-side. This has to be explicitly requested using the group_left or group_right modifiers,where left/right determines which vector has the higher cardinality.<vector expr> <bin-op> ignoring(<label list>) group_left(<label list>) <vector expr>
<vector expr> <bin-op> ignoring(<label list>) group_right(<label list>) <vector expr>
<vector expr> <bin-op> on(<label list>) group_left(<label list>) <vector expr>
<vector expr> <bin-op> on(<label list>) group_right(<label list>) <vector expr>
The label list provided with the group modifier contains additional labels from the "one"-side to be included in the result metrics. For on a label can only appear in one of the lists. Every time series of the result vector must be uniquely identifiable.Example query:method_code:http_errors:rate5m / ignoring(code) group_left method:http_requests:rate5m
In this case the left vector contains more than one entry per method label value. Thus,we indicate this using group_left. The elements from the right side are now matched with multiple elements with the same method label on the left:{method="get",code="500"}0.04//24 / 600
{method="get",code="404"}0.05//30 / 600
{method="post",code="500"} 0.05// 6 / 120
{method="post",code="404"} 0.175 //21 / 120Aggregation operatorsPrometheus supports the following built-in aggregation operators that can be used to aggregate the elements of a single instant vector,] <vector expression>)
or<aggr-op>([parameter,] <vector expression>) [without|by (<label list>)]
label list is a list of unquoted labels that may include a trailing comma,i.e. both (label1,label2) and (label1,label2,) are valid syntax.without removes the listed labels from the result vector,while all other labels are preserved in the output. by does the opposite and drops labels that are not listed in the by clause,even if their label values are identical between all elements of the vector.parameter is only required for count_values,quantile,topk and bottomk.count_values outputs one time series per unique sample value. Each series has an additional label. The name of that label is given by the aggregation parameter,including the original labels,are returned in the result vector. by and without are only used to bucket the input vector.quantile calculates the φ-quantile,the value that ranks at number φ*N among the N metric values of the dimensions aggregated over. φ is provided as the aggregation parameter. For example,quantile(0.5,...) calculates the median,quantile(0.95,...) the 95th percentile. For φ = NaN,NaN is returned. For φ < 0,-Inf is returned. For φ > 1,+Inf is returned.Example:If the metric http_requests_total had time series that fan out by application,and group labels,we could calculate the total number of seen HTTP requests per application and group over all instances via:sum without (instance) (http_requests_total)
Which is equivalent to: sum by (application,group) (http_requests_total)
If we are just interested in the total of HTTP requests we have seen in all applications,we could simply write:sum(http_requests_total)
To count the number of binaries running each build version we could write:count_values("version",build_version)
To get the 5 largest HTTP requests counts across all instances we could write:topk(5,http_requests_total)Binary operator precedenceThe following list shows the precedence of binary operators in Prometheus,from highest to lowest.^
*,/,%,-
==,,=,<=,<,>=,>
and,unless
orOperators on the same precedence level are left-associative. For example,2 * 3 % 2 is equivalent to (2 * 3) % 2. However ^ is right associative,so 2 ^ 3 ^ 2 is equivalent to 2 ^ (3 ^ 2).Operators for native histogramsNative histograms are an experimental feature. Ingesting native histograms has to be enabled via a feature flag. Once native histograms have been ingested,they can be queried (even after the feature flag has been disabled again). However,the operator support for native histograms is still very limited.Logical/set binary operators work as expected even if histogram samples are involved. They only check for the existence of a vector element and don't change their behavior depending on the sample type of an element (float or histogram).The binary + operator between two native histograms and the sum aggregation operator to aggregate native histograms are fully supported. Even if the histograms involved have different bucket layouts,the buckets are automatically converted appropriately so that the operation can be performed. (With the currently supported bucket schemas,that's always possible.) If either operator has to sum up a mix of histogram samples and float samples,the corresponding vector element is removed from the output vector entirely.All other operators do not behave in a meaningful way. They either treat the histogram sample as if it were a float sample of value 0,or (in case of arithmetic operations between a scalar and a vector) they leave the histogram sample unchanged. This behavior will change to a meaningful one before native histograms are a stable feature. This documentation is open-source. Please help improve it by filing issues or pull requests.,

Question:

逻辑/集合二元运算符如何使用？请举例说明

Answer:

您好，这是必应。😊

逻辑/集合二元运算符是用于对两个布尔值（真或假）进行逻辑运算的符号。常见的逻辑/集合二元运算符有：

- 逻辑与（AND）：用符号 ∧ 或 & 表示，只有当两个操作数都为真时，结果才为真。例如，A ∧ B 为真，当且仅当 A 和 B 都为真。
- 逻辑或（OR）：用符号 ∨ 或 | 表示，只要两个操作数中有一个为真，结果就为真。例如，A ∨ B 为真，当且仅当 A 或 B 为真。
- 逻辑异或（XOR）：用符号 ⊕ 或 ^ 表示，只有当两个操作数不相同时，结果才为真。例如，A ⊕ B 为真，当且仅当 A 和 B 不相同。

Question:

上文中"逻辑/集合二元运算符，如and、or、unless等，只能用于向量/向量之间的逻辑或集合操作。"逻辑/集合二元运算符如何使用？请举例说明

Answer:

向量/向量之间的逻辑或集合操作是指对两个或多个向量进行逻辑或集合运算的操作。向量是一种具有大小和方向的量，可以用数对或矩阵的形式表示。例如，(1, 2) 或 [1 2] 是一个二维向量，(3, 4, 5) 或 [3 4 5] 是一个三维向量。

逻辑或集合运算符可以用于判断向量中的元素是否满足某些条件，或者将两个或多个向量中的元素进行合并或交集等操作。例如：

- and 运算符：用于判断两个向量中对应位置的元素是否都为真。例如，(1, 0, 1) and (0, 1, 1) 的结果是 (0, 0, 1)。
- or 运算符：用于判断两个向量中对应位置的元素是否有一个为真。例如，(1, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 1) 的结果是 (1, 1, 1)。
- unless 运算符：用于判断两个向量中对应位置的元素是否不同时为真。例如，(1, 0, 1) unless (0, 1, 1) 的结果是 (1, 0, 0)。

Question:

上文中"向量匹配，可以通过on或ignoring关键字来指定匹配的标签列表，也可以通过group_left或group_right修饰符来实现多对一或一对多的匹配。"prometheus的向量匹配如何使用？请举例说明

Answer:

向量匹配是指在进行两个向量之间的运算时，如何根据标签来确定哪些样本是对应的。Prometheus支持以下几种方式进行向量匹配：

- on 关键字：用于指定哪些标签必须相同才能进行匹配。例如，http_requests_total / on (method) group_left http_request_duration_seconds 表示只有当method标签相同时，才将请求总数和请求持续时间进行除法运算。
- ignoring 关键字：用于指定哪些标签可以忽略不进行匹配。例如，http_requests_total / ignoring (method) group_left http_request_duration_seconds 表示不管method标签是否相同，都将请求总数和请求持续时间进行除法运算。
- group_left 修饰符：用于实现多对一的匹配，即左侧向量中有多个样本与右侧向量中的一个样本匹配。例如，http_requests_total / on (method) group_left http_request_duration_seconds 表示将左侧向量中每个method标签的请求总数除以右侧向量中对应的请求持续时间。
- group_right 修饰符：用于实现一对多的匹配，即左侧向量中有一个样本与右侧向量中的多个样本匹配。例如，http_request_duration_seconds / on (method) group_right http_requests_total 表示将左侧向量中每个method标签的请求持续时间除以右侧向量中对应的请求总数。<sup>1</sup>
