Conda: Myths and Misconceptions
Thu 25 August 2016I've spent much of the last decade using Python for my research,teaching Python tools to other scientists and developers,and developing Python tools for efficient data manipulation,scientific and statistical computation,and visualization. The Python-for-data landscape has changed immensely since I first installed NumPy and SciPy from via a flickering CRT display. Among the new developments since those early days,the one with perhaps the broadest impact on my daily work has been the introduction of conda,the open-source cross-platform package manager first released in 2012.In the four years since its initial release,many words have been spilt introducing conda and espousing its merits,but one thing I have consistently noticed is the number of misconceptions that seem to remain in the (often fervent) discussions surrounding this tool. I hope in this post to do a small part in putting these myths and misconceptions to rest.I've tried to be as succinct as I can,but if you want to skim this article and get the gist of the discussion,you can read each heading along with the the bold summary just below it.Myth #1: Conda is a distribution,not a package managerReality: Conda is a package manager,Anaconda is a distribution. Although Conda is packaged with Anaconda,the two are distinct entities with distinct goals.A software distribution is a pre-built and pre-configured collection of packages that can be installed and used on a system. A package manager is a tool that automates the process of installing,updating,and removing packages. Conda,with its "conda install","conda update",and "conda remove" sub-commands,containing only Conda and its dependencies,so that you can install what you need from scratch.But make no mistake: Conda is as distinct from Anaconda/Miniconda as is Python itself,see the conda FAQ.Myth #2: Conda is a Python package managerReality: Conda is a general-purpose package management system,it also works well with Python packages.Because conda arose from within the Python (more specifically PyData) community,it's less like pip,you are already probably taking advantage of many non-Python packages,there are 350 results: these are packages within my Conda/Python environment that are fundamentally unmanageable by Python-only tools like pip & virtualenv.Myth #3: Conda and pip are direct competitorsReality: Conda and pip serve different purposes,which stands for Pip Installs Packages,and is most commonly used to install packages published on the Python Package Index (PyPI). Both pip and PyPI are governed and supported by the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA).In short,conda is a language-agnostic cross-platform environment manager. For the user,conda installs any package within conda environments. If all you are doing is installing Python packages within an isolated environment,in which you can install packages without modifying your system Python installation.Even setting aside Myth #2,conda and pip serve different audiences and different purposes. If you want to,manage Python packages within an existing system Python installation,it can only install packages within conda environments. If you want to,work with the many Python packages which rely on external dependencies (NumPy,and Matplotlib are common examples),pip can't help you: by design,but rather tools focused on different groups of users and patterns of use.Myth #4: Creating conda in the first place was irresponsible & divisiveReality: Conda's creators pushed Python's standard packaging to its limits for over a decade,when doing anything in Python "There should be one – and preferably only one – obvious way to do it." So why would the creators of conda muddy the field by introducing a new way to install Python packages,As it turns out,the NumPy project forked distutils in an attempt to make it handle the complex requirements of a NumPy distribution. They bundled a large portion of NETLIB into a single monolithic Python package (you might know this as SciPy),forget about it. To read some of the details about these pain-points and how they led to Conda,As it turns out,in a Q&A on the subject of packaging difficulties,"it really sounds like your needs are so unusual compared to the larger Python community that you're just better off building your own" (See video of this discussion). Even while following this nugget of advice from the BDFL,and mentions the value of having multiple means of distribution tailored to the needs of specific users.Far from insinuating that Conda is divisive,and are working hard to better enable such tools to work seamlessly with the Python Package Index.Myth #5: conda doesn't work with virtualenv,but better is to use Conda's own environment manager: it is fully-compatible with pip and has several advantages over virtualenv.virtualenv/venv are utilites that allow users to create isolated Python environments that work with pip. Conda has its own built-in environment manager that works seamlessly with both conda and pip,including installation and updating of Python itself. Virtualenvs must be created upon an existing,for example seamlessly managing dependencies and parallel versions of essential tools like LAPACK or OpenSSL
Rather than environments built on symlinks – which break the isolation of the virtualenv and can be flimsy at times for non-Python dependencies – conda-envs are true isolated environments within a single executable path.
While virtualenvs are not compatible with conda packages,meaning the full software stack is entirely reproducible from a single environment metadata file.That said,it is possible:$ virtualenv test_conda$ source test_conda/bin/activate$ pip install conda$ conda install numpyThis installs conda's MKL-enabled NumPy package within your virtualenv. I wouldn't recommend this: I can't find documentation for this feature,trying to conda update python within the virtualenv fails in a very ungraceful and unrecoverable manner,but rather related to some subtle inconsistencies in the build process,for example).If you want to avoid these difficulties,the conda docs include a translation table between conda and pip/virtualenv commands.Myth #6: Now that pip uses wheels,and wheels have weaknesses that Conda's binaries address.One difficulty which drove the creation of Conda was the fact that pip could distribute only source code,an issue that was particularly challenging for users building extension-heavy modules like NumPy and SciPy. After Conda had solved this problem in its own way,a binary format designed to address this difficulty within pip. With this issue addressed within the common tool,Not necessarily. Distribution of cross-platform binaries was only one of the many problems solved within conda. Compiled binaries spotlight the other essential piece of conda: the ability to meaningfully track non-Python dependencies. Because pip's dependency tracking is limited to Python packages,conda includes a true dependency resolver,conda also allows things like linking builds to optimized linear algebra libraries,such as gcc,you better hope that your system has compilers and settings compatible with those used to originally build the wheel in question.Myth #7: conda is not open source,and Anaconda (the distribution) is nearly there as well.In the open source world,and the fact that Anaconda was created by Continuum Analytics and is a free component of a larger enterprise product causes some to worry.Let's set aside the fact that Continuum is,one of the few companies really doing open software the right way (a topic for another time). Ignoring that,distribute,update,available on GitHub and BSD-Licensed. Even for Anaconda (the distribution),there is no need to worry about intellectual property issues when using Conda.If the Anaconda/Miniconda distributions still worry you,though those are convenient avenues to its use. As we saw above,right,there is a community-led effort (Conda-Forge) to make conda packaging & distribution entirely open.Historically,and the process of getting a build updated has mostly relied on knowing someone at Continuum. Rumor is that this was largely because the original conda package creation process was not as well-defined and streamlined as it is today.But this is changing. Continuum is making the effort to open their package recipes,there is a new community-led – not Continuum affiliated – project,called conda-forge that contains tools for the creation of community-driven builds for any package. Packages are maintained in the open via github,AppVeyor for Windows builds,and package updates are accomplished through merging a Github pull request (here is an example of what a package update looks like in conda-forge).Conda-forge is entirely community-founded and community-led,Continuum's founders have publicly stated that this is a direction they would support. You can read more about the promise of conda-forge in Wes McKinney's recent blog post,but if Continuum Analytics folds,the company serves the community by providing free hosting of build artifacts. All software distributions need to be hosted by somebody,a website owned and maintained by Continuum Analytics. But there is nothing in Conda that requires this site. In fact,and there would be nothing to stop someone from building and hosting their own private distribution using Conda as a package manager (conda index is the relevant command). Given the openness of conda recipes and build systems on conda-forge,you should probably be equally worried about Rackspace – a for-profit company – serving the community by hosting the Python Package Index. In both cases,which is entirely free and open source. If either Rackspace or Continuum were to disappear,Reality: pip and conda serve different needs,Conda and pip are different projects with different intended audiences: pip installs python packages within any environment,one might hope that pip and conda could somehow be combined,it will never be able to meaningfully install and track all the non-Python packages that conda does: the architecture is Python-specific and (rightly) Python-focused. Pip,aims to be a flexible publication & distribution platform and manager for Python packages,it will never make sense for it to replace pip/PyPI as a general publishing & distribution platform for Python code. At its very core,it wouldn't allow you to,substitute Jython for Python in a given package. You could certainly use conda to build a Jython software stack,but once cost of that is its inability to precisely define and resolve dependencies as conda does.Finally,yum,and homebrew,buildout,and spack,as the Python Packaging Authority does,but as downstream tools that can take advantage of the heroic efforts of all those who have developed and maintained pip,So it seems we're left with two packaging solutions which are distinct,I think the main thing we can do is make sure the projects (1) work together as well as possible,conda is already has a fully open toolchain,perhaps eventually using it to replace conda's current default channel.As we push forward on this,PyPA has an open governance model with explicit goals,and well-defined channels of communication and discussion,on the other hand,but the model for governance and control of the system is far less explicit. Given the importance of conda particularly in the PyData community,folks involved with conda-forge have told me that this is currently being addressed by the core team,a code of conduct,currently most Python packages can be loaded to conda-forge with just a few steps:Post a public code release somewhere on the web (on github,PyPI,the binary builds on Windows,and Linux are automatically created and loaded to the conda-forge channel. Additionally,where package updates can be reviewed by collaborators and tested by CI systems before they go live.I find this process far preferable to the (by comparison relatively opaque and manual) process of publishing to PyPI,and creating an option to automatically build multi-platform wheels and source distributions,years ago I spent nearly a quarter with a colleague trying to install the complicated (non-Python) software stack that powers the megaman package,which we were developing together. The result of all our efforts was a single non-reproducible working stack on a single machine. Then conda-forge was introduced. We went through the process again,this time creating a conda recipe,from which a conda-forge feedstock was built. We now have a cross-platform solution that will install a working version of the package and its dependencies with a single command,in seconds,on nearly any computer. If there is a way to build and distribute software with that kind of dependency graph seamlessly with pip+PyPI,I haven't seen it.If you've read this far,I hope you've found this discussion useful. My own desire is that we as a community can continue to rally around both these tools,improving them for the benefit of current and future users. Python packaging has improved immensely in the last decade,and I'm excited to see where it will go from here.Thanks to Filipe Fernandez,Aaron Meurer,Bryan van de Ven,and Phil Elson for helpful feedback on early drafts of this post. As always,any mistakes are my own.conda
