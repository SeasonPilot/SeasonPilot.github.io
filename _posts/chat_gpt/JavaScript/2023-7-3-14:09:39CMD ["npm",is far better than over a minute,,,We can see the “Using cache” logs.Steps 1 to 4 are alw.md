Speed up your builds with Docker CacheSteve GrosboisPublié le 29 février 2016 - 2 min de lectureWhen you start with Docker,it seems normal to get inspired by some samples and examples you grabed around the web.First steps with DockerLet’s start,for example,with a simple nodejs project. You grab this nice Dockerfile,and,yes,it works great.FROM mhart/alpine-node
WORKDIR /src
# Copy your code in the docker image
COPY . /src
# Install your project dependencies
RUN npm install
# Expose the port 3000
EXPOSE 3000
# Set the default command to run when a container starts
CMD ["npm","start"]
Building again and again but no gainNow,you are working on your source code. And each time you want to build your image to test your code,the npm install.Know dockerHere comes three things to know :Docker build your image step by step.
Each step is dependent to the previous one.
Each step is cached by DockerBecause my code have changed,Docker use his cache before the step 3. After this,docker rebuild intermediates images from step 3 to step 6.We can see the “Removing intermediate container” logs : docker don’t use his cache for this steps because it depends on the step 3.Optimize your Dockerfile to get the best of cacheTo get the best of Docker cache :Think your Dockerfile like layers of images storted by specialization.First,i need a node ready image :
Second,i need a node image which working dir is /src
Then,i need a node ready image which working dir is /src and listening on port 3000 and running npm start as default command.
I need this previous image but with the node dependencies i specified in my package.json
Last step is the most specified step of this image,An optimized Dockerfile of my project :FROM mhart/alpine-node:5.6.0
WORKDIR /src
# Expose the port 3000
EXPOSE 3000
# Set the default command to run when a container starts
CMD ["npm",is far better than over a minute,,,We can see the “Using cache” logs.Steps 1 to 4 are always the same in our project,so cache is always used.The long npm install task at step 6 is only ran if there is a change on copied package.json file on step 5.The step 7 is the only step where an image is rebuilt based on previous steps when we make a change on our source code.We hope this post will help you gain time on your future Docker ready projects.Checkout our website and twitterDockerNodejsDevelopment,

这篇网页的文本内容是关于如何利用 Docker 缓存加速构建过程的。文章分析了 Docker 的构建原理，缓存机制和优化方法，并给出了一个 nodejs 项目的 Dockerfile 示例。文章的核心内容可以概括为：

- Docker 通过分步构建镜像，每一步都依赖于前一步，并且被 Docker 缓存。
- 为了充分利用 Docker 缓存，需要按照从通用到特定的顺序编写 Dockerfile，避免不必要的重复构建。
- 通过优化 Dockerfile，可以大大缩短构建时间，提高开发效率。
